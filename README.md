# PascGaloisZn
PascGalois Zn, like PascGalois JE, is a platform independent program developed for the exploration of one and two dimensional cellular automata. The difference between the two is that PascGalois Zn produces cellular automata over only Zn but allows you to use update rules that employ both addition and multiplication.
