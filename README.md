# PascGaloisZn

The PascGalois JE and PascGalois Zn programs were developed in support of the *The PascGalois Project: Visualizing Abstract Mathematics*, created by Dr. Mike Bardzell and Dr. Kathleen Shannon.  The PascGalois Project was made possible through two grants from the National Science Foundation, DUE-0087644 and DUE-0339477.  For more information, articles, and classroom resources, please see our website at **[The PascGalois Project: Visualizing Abstract Mathematics](https://faculty.salisbury.edu/~despickler/pascgalois/index.html)**.

**Download the Current Version (1.2.1)**

**Prerequisite:** If the Java JRE is not installed on your computer download and install the current version of the Java JRE (Version 8 or later).

**Windows Users**

The Windows distribution of this program is either as a single stand-alone executable file, PascGaloisZn.exe, or as a Windows installer, PascGaloisZnSetup.exe.

- For the stand-alone executable file:
  - Download the **[PascGaloisZn.exe](https://github.com/mathprofdes/PascGaloisZn/releases/download/v1.2.1/PascGaloisZn.exe)** file.
  - From Windows Explorer double-click the PascGaloisZn.exe file.
- For the Windows installer:
  - Download the **[PascGaloisZnSetup.exe](https://github.com/mathprofdes/PascGaloisZn/releases/download/v1.2.1/PascGaloisZnSetup.exe)** file.
  - From Windows Explorer double-click the PascGaloisZnSetup.exe file and follow the instructions on the screen. This will place links to the PascGalois Zn program in your Start menu.

**Linux and MacOS Users**

The software is being distributed as an executable jar file. 
  - Download the **[PascGaloisZn.jar](https://github.com/mathprofdes/PascGaloisZn/releases/download/v1.2.1/PascGaloisZn.jar)** file.
- In most cases you can simply double-click it from your system's file browser. You can also run it from the command-line with
`java -jar PascGaloisZn.jar`

**Program Description**

PascGalois Zn, like PascGalois JE, is a platform independent program developed for the exploration of one and two dimensional cellular automata. The difference between the two is that PascGalois Zn produces cellular automata over only Zn but allows you to use update rules that employ both addition and multiplication.  This is a Java application, so if the Java JRE is not installed on your computer download and install the current version of the Java JRE (Version 8 or later). You can get the most current version at the Java Web Site.  The software was created using the older Java Swing API, so the appearance is a little retro. This software has been tested on Windows 10 and 11, Linux Mint 21, and MacOS Mojave.

**Program Features**

- Supports one and two dimensional finite and infinite automata.
- User defined update rules that can use up to 20 previous timesteps and a support radius of 100.
- User defined seeds that can use up to 20 previous timesteps and a support radius of 100.
- Complete color and image manipulation facilities.
- Advanced counting facilities for fractal dimension calculations, cycles and automata death.
- POV-Ray export facilities for 2-D automata.
- Level and probability density plot capabilities.

**Note:** If you wish to explore cellular automata over other group structures including Zn, you might be interested in the PascGalois JE program that is available in my PascGaloisJE repository.
